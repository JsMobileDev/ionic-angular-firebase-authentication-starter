# Ionic and Firebase Authentication Starter

This is an authentication starter template built with Ionic and Firebase. It's
using Angular as the programming framework.

## Packages

It's using:

- `@angular`: "9.0.0"
- `@angular/fire`: "5.3.0"
- `@ionic/angular`: "5.0.0"
- `firebase`: "7.8.1"

I'll do my best to update the `README` when I update those packages.

## Contents

This starter templates has:

- Login Page
- Signup Page
- Reset Password Page
- Profile Page

It extracts the common login/signup/reset functionality into an authentication
component that creates the authentication form and passes the user credentials
to the parent component (_either Login, Signup, or ResetPassword_).

## Licence

The starter is licenced as MIT, you can read the full
[licence here](/licence.md).

## Payment

The template is free, but if you want to give me money, you can do it through
[this link](https://paypal.me/javebratt). Contact me if you need an invoice to
mark it as a business expense.

## Usage

I have built a tutorial that explains how to use this starter. You can find it
in the
[Firebase Authentication](https://courses.jsmobiledev.com/course/authentication/intro)
course on my [main course site](https://courses.jsmobiledev.com/).
