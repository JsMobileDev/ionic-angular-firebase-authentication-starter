# Ionic and Firebase Authentication Starter

This is an authentication starter template built with Ionic and Firebase. It's using Angular as the programming framework.

## Packages

It's using:

- `@angular`: "~8.1.2"
- `@angular/fire`: "^5.2.1"
- `@ionic/angular`: "^4.7.1"
- `firebase`: "^6.3.3"
- `rxjs`: "~6.5.1"

I'll do my best to update the `README` when I update those packages.

## Contents

This starter templates has:

- Login Page
- Signup Page
- Reset Password Page
- Profile Page

It extracts the common login/signup/reset functionality into an authentication component that creates the authentication form and passes the user credentials to the parent component (_either Login, Signup, or ResetPassword_).

## Licence

The starter is licenced as MIT, you can read the full [licence here](/licence.md).

## Payment

The template is free, but if you want to give memoney, you can do it through [this link](https://paypal.me/javebratt) and contact me if you need an invoice to mark it as a business expense.

## Usage

(_Bare with me here :P_) I'm working on building a tutorial in how to use it, it will live on my [main site](https://javebratt.com).
